# Python Crash Course - Alien Invasion

Above is my implementation of the course tutorial for Space Invaders within [Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280). 

In this project, I learned more features and best practices within Python. Instruction given detailed how to implement the PyGame Library, and how to use the tool and tricks within python given to me through this course.
